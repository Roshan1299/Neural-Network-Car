            <h2>ðŸ§  About the AI System</h2>
            <p>
                This project simulates autonomous agents â€” virtual self-driving cars â€” trained using evolutionary machine learning techniques.
                Each car is controlled by a lightweight feedforward neural network, which takes in real-time sensor inputs to make navigation decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The training is entirely unsupervised: no predefined routes or rewards are manually given. 
                Instead, a genetic algorithm evolves the neural networks across generations by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fitness Evaluation</strong> â€” scoring cars based on how far they travel without crashing.</li>
                <li><strong>Selection</strong> â€” cloning the best-performing neural networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Mutation</strong> â€” introducing random small changes to improve exploration of solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Over successive generations, this process leads to increasingly competent AI agents, capable of navigating complex, dynamically generated tracks without direct programming of driving strategies.
